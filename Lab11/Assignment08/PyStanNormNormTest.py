"""
Test an installation of PyStan using a simple normal mean estimation problem.

The script does a Stan fit to simulated data from a normal distribution,
estimating the mean with a normal prior/normal sampling dist'n model.  It prints
summaries of the posterior to the terminal, and plots two figures showing
traceplots (of the posterior mean and the log density) and an estimated
posterior PDF (blue curve) along with the analytical PDF (green dashed curve).

Three statistical tests are run, with results printed to the terminal.  They
will occasionally fail even with a sound installation, but this should happen
only rarely.

Run with "ipython -i" to keep the plots displayed, and to allow interaction
with the fit.

Windows notes:

PyStan requires access to a C++ compiler compatible with your Python installation;
it uses it to build a Python extension implementing a Stan model.  This script
was tested with Windows 8.1 and Anaconda Python 2.7, using the Stan project's 
binary installation of PyStan, and Microsoft's free compiler for Python 2.7:

  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

This is a version of the 2008 Visual C++ compiler, the version used by 
Continuum and Python.org for Windows binary builds of the Python 2.7 series.
Python 3 instead uses the 2010 version.  Unfortunately, Microsoft has not
released a 2010 compiler package for Python 3.  This script has not been
tested for Python 3.  For one approach to enable support for building Python 3
extensions, see:

  http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/12/21/compiling-python-extensions-on-windows/

Running PyStan on Windows requires some script elements not needed by other
platforms; this script uses Python's platform module to conditionally
include these elements.

Finally, on Windows, Anaconda Python by default will try to use the
Cygwin gcc compiler, not the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler.  To
change the default behavior, create a distutils configuration file
with these two lines in it:

[build]
compiler = msvc

For local use with this script, the file should be named 'setup.cfg' and
should be in the directory where you run this script.  To make this
change globally, see the distutils configuration documentation for
the appropriate file name and location:
