    "> * Using the same $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, show that the equillibrium distribution really is an equillibrium distribution by simulating paths initialized from the equillibrium distribution, and showing that the distribution is maintained.\n",
    "> * Using paths of the same length that you used above, create **two** new chains, with the same equillibrium distribution, one of which converges so slowly that equillibrium is not reached, and one that converges more quickly than the $(0.07,0.03)$ chain."

Calling it should start a Markov chain with the parameter value `param0`, and return an array of `n` samples that are approximate draws from the posterior distribution, along with an estimate of the acceptance rate of the chain."
